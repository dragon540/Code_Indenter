# SourceCode Indenter

Many times the source code written without the help of IDEs and source code editors may lack proper indenting and formatting.
This program takes a C source code file as input and convert it into a properly formatted and indented source 
code file.

The project is limited to indenting C programming language.

## Example

| Unindented Source Code File | Indented Source Code File |
|:---------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
|  ![](/Pictures/Input.png)   | ![](/Pictures/Output.png) |
